%%% INSERT YOUR INTRO HERE
% Welcome to the ACL Workshop on Unresolved Matters. We received
% 17 submissions, and due to a rigerous review process, we rejected 16. 

For this 15th iteration of the International Conference on Educational
Data Mining (EDM 2022), the conference returned to England, this time to
Durham, with an online hybrid format for virtual participation as well.
EDM is organized under the auspices of the International Educational
Data Mining Society. The conference, held July 24th through 27th, 2022,
follows fourteen previous editions (fully online in 2021 and 2020,
Montréal 2019, Buffalo 2018, Wuhan 2017, Raleigh 2016, Madrid 2015,
London 2014, Memphis 2013, Chania 2012, Eindhoven 2011, Pittsburgh 2010,
Cordoba, 2009 and Montréal 2008).

The theme of this year's conference is Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and
Accessibility (IDEA) in EDM Research and Practice. This theme emphasizes
the importance of considering and broadening who is included -- or not
included -- in EDM, and why. Furthermore, the theme speaks to the
importance of IDEA considerations in all stages of the research process,
from participant recruitment and selection, data collection, methods,
analysis, results, to the application of research results in the future.
The conference features three invited talks: Jennifer Hill, Professor of
Applied Statistics at New York University, USA; René Kizilcec, Assistant
Professor of Information Science at Cornell University, USA; and Judy
Robertson, Professor of Digital Learning at the University of Edinburgh,
Scotland. As in the past few years of EDM, this year's conference also
includes an invited keynote talk by the 2021 winner of the EDM Test of
Time Award. The talk is delivered by Tiffany Barnes, Distinguished
Professor of Computer Science at North Carolina State University, USA.

This year's EDM conference continued the double-blind review process
that started in 2019. The program committee was once again extended,
this time using an interest survey process, to better reflect the
community presenting works and to keep the review load for each member
manageable. EDM received 90 submissions to the full papers track (10
pages), of which 26 were accepted (28.9\%), while a further 12 were
accepted as short papers (6 pages) and 14 as posters (4 pages). There
were 56 submissions to the short paper track, of which 17 were accepted
(30.4\%) and a further 20 were accepted as posters. The poster and demo
track itself accepted 10 contributions out of 20 submissions.

The EDM 2022 conference also held a Journal of Educational Data Mining
(JEDM) Track that provides researchers a venue to deliver more
substantial mature work than is possible in a conference proceeding and
to present their work to a live audience. The papers submitted to this
track followed the JEDM peer review process. Five papers were submitted
and two papers are featured in the conference's program.

The main conference invited contributions to an Industry Track in
addition to the main track. The EDM 2022 Industry Track received six
submissions of which four were accepted. The EDM conference also
continues its tradition of providing opportunities for young researchers
to present their work and receive feedback from their peers and senior
researchers. The doctoral consortium this year features nine such
presentations.

In addition to the main program, there are six workshops and tutorials:
\emph{Causal Inference in Educational Data Mining (Third Annual Half-Day
Workshop)}, \emph{6th Educational Data Mining in Computer Science
Education (CSEDM) Workshop}, \emph{FATED 2022: Fairness, Accountability,
and Transparency in Educational Data}, \emph{The Third Workshop of The
Learner Data Institute: Big Data, Research Challenges, \& Science
Convergence in Educational Data Science}, \emph{Rethinking
Accessibility: Applications in Educational Data Mining}, and
\emph{Tutorial: Using the Open Science Framework to promote Open Science
in Education Research}.

We thank the sponsors of EDM 2022 for their generous support: DuoLingo,
ETS, Durham University Department of Computer Science, and Durham
University School of Education. We are also thankful to the senior
program committee and regular program committee members and reviewers,
without whose expert input this conference would not be possible.
Finally, we thank the entire organizing team and all authors who
submitted their work to EDM 2022. And we thank EasyChair for their
infrastructural support.

The program committee chairs discussed and nominated four full papers
and four short papers for best paper and best student paper awards,
based on reviews, review scores, and meta-reviews. The papers and
reviews (both anonymous) were then sent to a best paper award committee
who ranked the papers. The highest-ranked paper was awarded the best
paper award, while the next-highest ranked paper with a student first
author was awarded the best student paper award.

%\textbf{Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh: Ellipsis in Compositional Distributional Semantics}
%
%Ellipsis is a natural language phenomenon where part of a sentence is missing and its information must be recovered from its surrounding context, as in ``Cats chase dogs and so do foxes.''. Formal semantics offers different methods for resolving ellipsis and recovering the missing information, but the problem has not been considered for distributional semantics, where words have vector embeddings and combinations thereof provide embeddings for sentences. In elliptical sentences these combinations go beyond linear as copying of elided information is necessary. I will talk about recent results in our NAACL 2019 paper, joint with G. Wijnholds, where we develop different models for embedding VP-elliptical sentences using modal sub-exponential categorial grammars. We extend existing verb disambiguation and sentence similarity datasets to ones containing elliptical phrases and evaluate our models on these datasets for a variety of linear and non-linear combinations. Our results show that indeed resolving ellipsis improves the performance of vectors and tensors on these tasks and it also sheds some light on disambiguating their sloppy and strict  readings.

%\textbf{Ellie Pavlick: What Should Constitute Natural Language ``understanding''?}
%
%Natural language processing has become indisputably good over the past few years. We can perform retrieval and question answering with purported super-human accuracy, and can generate full documents of text that seem good enough to pass the Turing test. In light of these successes, it is tempting to attribute the empirical performance to a deeper "understanding" of language that the models have acquired. Measuring natural language "understanding", however, is itself an unsolved research problem. In this talk, I will discuss recent work which attempts to illuminate what it is that state-of-the-art models of language are capturing. I will describe approaches which evaluate the models' inferential behaviour, as well as approaches which rely on inspecting the models' internal structure directly. I will conclude with results on human's linguistic inferences, which highlight the challenges involved with developing prescriptivist language tasks for evaluating computational models.

%\textbf{Raffaella Bernardi: Beyond Task Success: A Closer Look at Jointly Learning to See, Ask,
%and GuessWhat}
%
%The development of conversational agents that ground language into visual information is a challenging problem that requires the integration of dialogue management skills with multimodal understanding. Recently, visual dialogue settings have entered the scene of the Machine Learning and Computer Vision communities thanks to the construction of visually grounded human-human dialogue datasets against which Neural Network models (NNs) have been challenged. I will present our work on GuessWhat?! in which two NN agents interact to each other so that one of the two (the Questioner), by asking questions to the other (the Answerer), can guess which object the Answerer has in mind among all the entities in a given image (GuessWhat?!).  I will present our Questioner model: it encodes both visual and textual inputs, produces a multimodal representation, generates natural language questions, understands the Answerers' responses and guesses the object. I will compare our model's dialogues with models that exploit much more complex learning paradigms, like Reinforcement Learning, showing that more complex machine learning methods do not necessarily correspond to better dialogue quality or even better quantitative performance. The talk is based on work available at \url{https://vista-unitn-uva.github.io/}.

\subsubsection{Deep Down, Everyone Wants to be Causal (Jennifer
Hill)}\label{deep-down-everyone-wants-to-be-causal-jennifer-hill}}

\emph{Abstract:} Most researchers in the social, behavioral, and health
sciences are taught to be extremely cautious in making causal claims.
However, causal inference is a necessary goal in research for addressing
many of the most pressing questions around policy and practice. In the
past decade, causal methodologists have increasingly been using and
touting the benefits of more complicated machine learning algorithms to
estimate causal effects. These methods can take some of the guesswork
out of analyses, decrease the opportunity for ``p-hacking,'' and may be
better suited for more fine-tuned tasks such as identifying varying
treatment effects and generalizing results from one population to
another. However, should these more advanced methods change our
fundamental views about how difficult it is to infer causality? In this
talk, I will discuss some potential advantages and disadvantages of
using machine learning for causal inference and emphasize ways that we
can all be more transparent in our inferences and honest about their
limitations.

\subsubsection{Beyond Algorithmic Fairness in Education: Equitable and
Inclusive Decision-Support Systems (René

\emph{Abstract:} Advancing equity and inclusion in schools and
universities has long been a priority in education research. While
data-driven predictive models could help improve social injustices in
education, many studies from other domains suggest instead that these
models tend to exacerbate existing inequities without added precautions.
A growing body of research from the educational data mining and
neighboring communities is beginning to map out where biases are likely
to occur, what contributes to them, and how to mitigate them. These
efforts to advance algorithmic fairness are an important research
direction, but it is critical to also consider how AI systems are used
in educational contexts to support decisions and judgements. In this
talk, I will survey research on algorithmic fairness and explore the
role of human factors in AI systems and their implications for advancing
equity and inclusion in education.

Teachers in Educational Data Mining (Judy

\emph{Abstract:} The conference theme this year emphasises the
broadening of participation and inclusion in educational data mining; in
this talk, I will discuss methodologies for including learners and
teachers throughout the research process. This involves not only
preventing harm to young learners which might result from insufficient
care when processing their data but also embracing their participation
in the design and evaluation of educational data mining technologies. I
will argue that even young learners can and should be included in the
analysis and interpretation of data which affects them. I will give
examples of a project in which children have the role of data activists,
using classroom sensor data to explore their readiness to learn.

Problem Solving and Persistence (Tiffany
Barnes)}\label{test-of-time-award-compassionate-data-driven-tutors-for-problem-solving-and-persistence-tiffany-barnes}}

\emph{Abstract:} Determining how, when, and whether to provide
personalized support is a well-known challenge called the assistance
dilemma. A core problem in solving the assistance dilemma is the need to
discover when students are unproductive so that the tutor can intervene.
This is particularly challenging for open-ended domains, even those that
are well-structured with defined principles and goals. In this talk, I
will present a set of data-driven methods to classify, predict, and
prevent unproductive problem-solving steps in the well-structured
open-ended domains of logic and programming. Our approaches leverage and
extend my work on the Hint Factory, a set of methods that to build
data-driven intelligent tutor supports using prior student solution
attempts. In logic, we devised a HelpNeed classification model that uses
prior student data to determine when students are likely to be
unproductive and need help learning optimal problem-solving strategies.
In a controlled study, we found that students receiving proactive
assistance on logic when we predicted HelpNeed were less likely to avoid
hints during training, and produced significantly shorter, more optimal
posttest solutions in less time. In a similar vein, we have devised a
new data-driven method that uses student trace logs to identify
struggling moments during a programming assignment and determine the
appropriate time for an intervention. We validated our algorithm's
classification of struggling and progressing moments with experts rating
whether they believe an intervention is needed for a sample of 20\% of
the dataset. The result shows that our automatic struggle detection
method can accurately detect struggling students with less than 2
minutes of work with 77\% accuracy. We further evaluated a sample of 86
struggling moments, finding 6 reasons that human tutors gave for
intervention from missing key components to needing confirmation and
next steps. This research provides insight into the when and why for
programming interventions. Finally, we explore the potential of what
supports data-driven tutors can provide, from progress tracking to
worked examples and encouraging messages, and their importance for
compassionately promoting persistence in problem solving.

\subsubsection{Empirical Evaluation of Deep Learning Models for
Knowledge Tracing: Of Hyperparameters and Metrics on Performance and
Replicability}\label{empirical-evaluation-of-deep-learning-models-for-knowledge-tracing-of-hyperparameters-and-metrics-on-performance-and-replicability}}

\emph{Abstract:} New knowledge tracing models are continuously being
proposed, even at a pace where state-of-the- art models cannot be
compared with each other at the time of publication. This leads to a
situation where ranking models is hard, and the underlying reasons of
models' performance -- be it architectural choices, hyperparameter
tuning, performance metrics, or data -- is often underexplored. In this
work, we review and evaluate a body of deep learning knowledge tracing
(DLKT) models with openly available and widely-used data sets, and with
a novel data set of students learning to program. The evaluated
knowledge tracing models include Vanilla-DKT, two Long Short-Term Memory
Deep Knowledge Trac- ing (LSTM-DKT) variants, two Dynamic Key-Value
Memory Network (DKVMN) variants, and Self- Attentive Knowledge Tracing
(SAKT). As baselines, we evaluate simple non-learning models, logistic
regression and Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT). To evaluate how
different aspects of DLKT models influence model performance, we test
input and output layer variations found in the compared models that are
independent of the main architectures. We study maximum attempt count
options, including filtering out long attempt sequences, that have been
implicitly and explicitly used in prior studies. We contrast the
observed performance variations against variations from non-model
properties such as randomness and hardware. Performance of models is
assessed using multiple metrics, whereby we also contrast the im- pact
of the choice of metric on model performance. The key contributions of
this work are the following: Evidence that DLKT models generally
outperform more traditional models, but not necessarily by much and not
always; Evidence that even simple baselines with little to no predictive
value may outperform DLKT models, especially in terms of accuracy --
highlighting importance of selecting proper baselines for comparison;
Disambiguation of properties that lead to better performance in DLKT
models including metric choice, input and output layer variations,
common hyperparameters, random seeding and hard- ware; Discussion of
issues in replicability when evaluating DLKT models, including
discrepancies in prior reported results and methodology. Model
implementations, evaluation code, and data are published as a part of
this work.

\hypertarget{latent-skill-mining-and-labeling-from-courseware-content}{%
\subsubsection{Latent Skill Mining and Labeling from Courseware
Content}\label{latent-skill-mining-and-labeling-from-courseware-content}}

\emph{Abstract:} A model that maps the requisite skills, or knowledge
components, to the contents of an online course is necessary to
implement many adaptive learning technologies. However, developing a
skill model and tagging courseware contents with individual skills can
be expensive and error prone. We propose a technology to automatically
identify latent skills from instructional text on existing online
courseware called SMART (\textbf{S}kill \textbf{M}odel mining with
\textbf{A}utomated detection of \textbf{R}esemblance among
\textbf{T}exts). SMART is capable of mining, labeling, and mapping
skills without using an existing skill model or student learning (aka
response) data. The goal of our proposed approach is to mine latent
skills from assessment items included in existing courseware, provide
discovered skills with human-friendly labels, and map didactic paragraph
texts with skills. This way, mapping between assessment items and
paragraph texts is formed. In doing so, automated skill models produced
by SMART will reduce the workload of courseware developers while
enabling adaptive online content at the launch of the course. In our
evaluation study, we applied SMART to two existing authentic online
courses. We then compared machine-generated skill models and
human-crafted skill models in terms of the accuracy of predicting
students' learning. We also evaluated the similarity between
machine-generated and human-crafted skill models. The results show that
student models based on SMART-generated skill models were equally
predictive of students' learning as those based on human-crafted skill
models -- as validated on two OLI courses. Also, SMART can generate
skill models that are highly similar to human-crafted models as
evidenced by the normalized mutual information (NMI) values.

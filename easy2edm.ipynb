    "- See the [README](README.md) for how to download and structure the EasyChair data\n",
    "- Change the ISBN and decision types below to suit\n",
    "- Make the frontmatter in `./book-proceedings/book-proceedings.tex` so you know what page publications start on\n",
    "- Run the cells below **using that start page as a parameter** to generate the bibtex in `./proceedings/cdrom/bib` and to organize the accepted pdfs in `./proceedings/cdrom/pdf`\n",
    "- Elsewhere, generate the DOIs, add them to the bibtex above, and place into `./proceedings/cdrom/bib-with-doi`\n",
    "- Run the cell below to stamp the pdfs with the doi-enhanced bibtex, putting the stamped pdfs into `./proceedings/cdrom/stamped`\n",
    "- Build `./book-proceedings/book-proceedings.tex`; this will bring in the stamped pdfs and compile the proceedings as a pdf book\n",
    "    - Check that the stamp on several papers matches their actual pagination in the book\n",
    "- Use pdftk or similar to slice out the frontmatter, then use the bibtex cell below to create bibtex for it (if desired)"

There are many approaches that have been suggested, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods. Unlike in prior research, where detecting paraphrases in short and sentence-level texts has been done, we focus on the not yet explored area of paraphrase detection in paragraphs. We consider that the meaning of a piece of text can be broken into more than one sentence, this is over and above the sentences as extracted from two benchmark datasets (Webis-CPC-11 and MSRP). TF-IDF, Bleu metric, N-gram overlap, and Word2vec are used as features, then SVM is invoked as a classifier. The contribution of this paper clearly indicates that, on a commonly used evaluation set, text at the length of a paragraph is more appropriate to consider than short or long text for ML and DL approaches. Additionally, our method outperforms the existing work done on the Webis-CPC-11 dataset.'), \n",

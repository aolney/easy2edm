- Accept codes must match ACL codes, e.g. ACCEPT
- Use Thunar rename tool to rename papers to match ACL naming
    - Unclear if paper # needs to be sequential or can be as is
- To get abstracts, go to Premium -> Conference data download -> View tables or download a subset of them -> click here -> submission.csv

## Strategy, 5/19

- EDM combines take into a single progressions but ACL handles each separately
- To modify to our purpose, create a subfolder for each **Easy Chair** track that strictly follows the ACL model, then have a single top level build folder that builds the proceedings
  - Table of contents
    - Keynotes (not easy chair)
    - JEDM presentations  (not easy chair)
    - Full papers
    - Short papers
    - Posters
    - Doctoral consortium
    - Industry track
    - Workshop abstracts (not easy chair)
